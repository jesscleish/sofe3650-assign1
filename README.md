## Assignment Overview
This program uses abstract factories to create products for inventory, and sets the price of the product.  The price of the product is read from a csv file of product names and prices.

Upon construction, each product parses through the `prices.csv`

## Limitations
The product names are case sensistive for the csv, thus to minimize error all capital letters were used.
